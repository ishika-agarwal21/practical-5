                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
                    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. <br>
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
                    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
                    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>
                    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
